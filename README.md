Using OpenGL in Visual Studio

This was really my first time diving into trying to create 3D graphics. Also my first time using Visual Studio, which I really like so far. I learned a lot with OpenGL. I could not include my final project ZIP folder because it was too big and github won't let me add it so I added pictures along with an exe file to run, (which doens't show my textures added). 

This course helped me to consider how I would model and design a 3D picture. You have to break things down into a process of 
"How can I model this object and with what shapes."

In my project I broke each object down into a certain shape group, and came up with code to create that shape. In any modeling 
in the future I will follow this same approach. 

Coming up with the code was tough in some instances, but there is a lot avialable online to help. I was able to find 
some examples that helped me to see how I could use loops and iterations to draw and create different types of shapes. 

It took me a while to get to the point of the final submission of the final project. I hit a road block with loading 
textures and was having trouble getting them to work. It's one of those things you struggle with but when you get it 
you realize you only had one little thing wrong. once I had the files set up in the proper location, and name correctly, 
as .bmp files, I was able to get them to work. 

This knowledge of OpenGL may help me in my career in the future. I'm not sure if I will use in the future or not 
but now knowledge of its use in fresh in my brain. I also appreciate getting more familiar with visual studio 
in this course.
